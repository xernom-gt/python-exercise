# data types are used to store simple values.
# so data type have 4 elements
integer = 25
float = 3.5
boolean = True
string = "hello"
print (type(string)) # string to store a set of text or characters
print (type(integer)) # integer for whole, positive and negative numbers including zero
print (type(float)) # float for decimal number
print (type(boolean)) # the value is only True or False useful in programming logic (branching, looping)
