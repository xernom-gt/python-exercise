print #print is a command to display output to screen monitor

print ("hello world")

    # you must be asking why use () and "" or '' after entering print?
    # quotation marks ('') or ("") are used to mark stringsâ€”that is, the set of characters you want to print or display

# define strings
# so this sign determines whether the input is program code or a variable

print ('hello world') # this is plain text
# print (hello world) # this is an error, Python thinks "Hello" and "World" are variables

# and in python there are 2 quotes like ' ' and " " which have their respective functions like '
# # hello "world"' then the output is like hello "world" and vice versa
